## Prerequisites

### 1. Azure App Registration (Optional - For Automated Scenarios)

> **Note:** This script uses interactive authentication by default. App registration is only needed for automated/unattended scenarios.

#### Step 1: Register Application in Azure AD

1. Navigate to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Go to **Azure Active Directory** ‚Üí **App registrations** ‚Üí **New registration**
3. Configure the application:
   - **Name:** `Defender Threat Submission Reporter`
   - **Supported account types:** `Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)`
   - **Redirect URI:** Leave blank for now
4. Click **Register**

#### Step 2: Configure API Permissions

1. In your app registration, go to **API permissions**
2. Click **Add a permission** ‚Üí **Microsoft Graph** ‚Üí **Application permissions**
3. Add the following permissions:
   - `ThreatSubmission.Read.All`
   - `Mail.ReadBasic.All`
4. Click **Add permissions**
5. Click **Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]** (requires admin)
6. Verify status shows green checkmarks

#### Step 3: Create Client Secret (Optional)

1. Go to **Certificates & secrets** ‚Üí **Client secrets** ‚Üí **New client secret**
2. Description: `Threat Submission Script`
3. Expires: Choose appropriate duration (recommended: 12-24 months)
4. Click **Add**
5. **IMPORTANT:** Copy the secret value immediately (you won't see it again)

#### Step 4: Note Your Application Details

Copy these values for later use:
- **Application (client) ID:** Found on Overview page
- **Directory (tenant) ID:** Found on Overview page
- **Client Secret Value:** Copied from step 3

#### Using App Registration with the Script

If you want to use app-based authentication instead of interactive:

```powershell
# Connect using app credentials (modify script or use this approach)
$ClientId = "your-app-id-here"
$TenantId = "your-tenant-id-here"
$ClientSecret = "your-secret-here"

$SecureSecret = ConvertTo-SecureString $ClientSecret -AsPlainText -Force
$Credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($ClientId, $SecureSecret)

Connect-MgGraph -TenantId $TenantId -ClientSecretCredential $Credential
```

> **Security Note:** The current script uses interactive authentication with delegated permissions, which is more secure for manual execution. App-based authentication is recommended only for automation scenarios.

### 2. Microsoft Graph PowerShell Module

```powershell
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

### 3. Microsoft Defender Configuration (CRITICAL)

#### Configure User Reported Settings

1. Navigate to [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com)
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Email & collaboration** ‚Üí **User reported settings**
3. Under **Microsoft Outlook Report Message button**, select one of:
   - ‚úÖ **Send reported messages to Microsoft only**
   - ‚úÖ **Send reported messages to Microsoft and my reporting mailbox**
4. Click **Save**

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** If user reports only go to a mailbox and NOT to Microsoft, this API will return ZERO results!

#### Enable User Reporting in Outlook

Ensure users have one of these reporting methods:
- **Built-in Outlook Report button** (Microsoft 365 Apps)
- **Report Message add-in** (available from Microsoft)
- **Report Phishing add-in** (available from Microsoft)

To deploy add-ins organization-wide:
1. Go to [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Integrated apps**
3. Click **Get apps** ‚Üí Search for "Report Message" or "Report Phishing"
4. Deploy to users/groups

### 4. Required Permissions

#### For Interactive Authentication (Default)
The script uses Microsoft's built-in consent flow. On first run, you'll be prompted to consent to:
- `ThreatSubmission.Read.All` - Read threat submissions
- `Mail.ReadBasic` - For Message-ID recovery from user mailboxes

#### Required Azure AD Roles
Your user account needs one of these roles:
- **Security Administrator**
- **Security Reader**
- **Global Administrator**
- **Global Reader**

#### Verifying Your Roles
```powershell
# Check your current roles
Connect-MgGraph
Get-MgUserMemberOf -UserId (Get-MgContext).Account | Select-Object AdditionalProperties
```

## Troubleshooting

### Empty Results?

**Most common causes:**

1. ‚ùå User reported settings not configured to send to Microsoft
2. ‚ùå No user reports in the specified time range
3. ‚ùå Wrong tenant or insufficient permissions
4. ‚ùå Filters excluding all data

**Quick diagnostic test:**

```powershell
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "ThreatSubmission.Read.All"
Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Method GET -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/security/threatSubmission/emailThreats?`$top=5"
```

### Permission Errors

Ensure you have granted admin consent for the required permissions in Azure AD.

### Connection Issues

```powershell
# Disconnect and reconnect
Disconnect-MgGraph
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "ThreatSubmission.Read.All","Mail.ReadBasic"
```

## Message-ID Recovery

The script automatically attempts to recover missing Message IDs by:

1. Querying the recipient's mailbox via Graph API
2. Matching by sender, subject, and timestamp (¬±60 minutes)
3. Creating alternative identifiers when recovery is not possible

**Message ID prefixes:**
- `RETRIEVED:` - Successfully recovered from mailbox
- `ALT-ID:` - Alternative identifier created
- No prefix - Original ID from Threat Submission API

## Security & Privacy

- ‚úÖ No credentials stored in the script
- ‚úÖ Uses interactive authentication via Microsoft Graph
- ‚úÖ Requires user sign-in on each execution
- ‚úÖ Data stays local - only HTML report is generated

## Requirements Summary

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| PowerShell | 5.1 or higher |
| Graph Module | Microsoft.Graph |
| Permissions | ThreatSubmission.Read.All, Mail.ReadBasic |
| Defender Config | User reports sent to Microsoft |
| Role | Security Admin/Reader or Global Admin |
